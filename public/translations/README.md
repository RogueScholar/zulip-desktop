# How to help translate Zulip Desktop

These are _generated_ files (\*) that contain translations of the strings in
the app.

You can help translate Zulip Desktop into your language! We do our
translations in Weblate, which is a nice web app for collaborating on
translations; a maintainer then syncs those translations into this repo.
To help out, [join the Zulip project on
Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/zulip/) and enter translations
there. More details in the [Zulip contributor docs](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/translating/translating.html#translators-workflow).

Within that Weblate project, if you'd like to focus on Zulip Desktop, look
at the **Desktop** component. The other components are for the Zulip web/mobile
app, where translations are also very welcome.

(\*) One file is an exception: `en.json` is maintained by `i18next-cli extract` as a
list of (English) messages in the source code, and is used by Weblate as
a list of strings to be translated. It doesn't contain any
translations.
